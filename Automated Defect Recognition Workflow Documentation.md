# Automated Defect Recognition Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the workflow of an Automated Defect Recognition (ADR) system used in industrial X-ray and CT inspection environments.

The ADR system automatically analyzes inspection images and detects defects using machine learning models. It helps reduce manual inspection effort and improves consistency in defect detection.

The workflow described here is based on concepts used in inspection software such as the ADR system available in X|approver developed by :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

# System Architecture

![ADR Architecture](architecture-diagram.png)

The system architecture consists of the following main components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| X-ray / CT Scanner | Captures inspection images of industrial components |
| Image Processing Layer | Prepares and normalizes images for analysis |
| ADR Engine | Runs machine learning models to detect defects |
| Inspection Interface | Displays inspection results to the operator |
| Reporting Module | Generates inspection reports |

# Inspection Workflow

The inspection process follows these steps:

1. The component is scanned using X-ray or CT equipment.
2. The captured image is sent to the processing system.
3. The ADR engine analyzes the image using trained models.
4. The system detects potential defects.
5. Results are presented to the operator for validation.

# Machine Learning Training Pipeline

The ADR system uses a training pipeline to build defect detection models.

| Step | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Image Dataset Collection | CT or X-ray images are collected from inspections |
| Annotation | Experts label defects in images |
| Model Training | Machine learning models learn defect patterns |
| Model Validation | Accuracy of the model is tested |
| Deployment | Trained model is used in production inspection |

# Defect Detection Flow

The ADR system processes inspection images in the following sequence:

1. Image acquisition from inspection equipment
2. Image preprocessing
3. Feature extraction
4. Defect classification
5. Inspection decision (Pass / Fail)

# Benefits of ADR Systems

Automated inspection systems provide several advantages:

- Faster inspection of components
- Reduced manual inspection effort
- Improved defect detection accuracy
- Consistent inspection results
- Scalable inspection workflows
